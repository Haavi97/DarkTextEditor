# Dark Text Editor
> Simple dark text editor GUI using pyQT

I was a bit tired of the Notepad aplication that Windows has for the simple texts since it cannot be configured to be in dark mode. I know I can use some IDE like VSC but for simple things it is handy to have an easy launch simple text editor. That's why I have programmed this one. Also for fun of learning PyQT.
